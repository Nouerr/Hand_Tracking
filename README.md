This project is dedicated to the development of a real-time hand tracking system. Utilizing advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms, we aim to accurately track hand movements and gestures


## Features
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Our system is capable of tracking hand movements in real-time, providing immediate feedback.
- **Gesture Recognition**: The project can recognize predefined hand gestures, opening up possibilities for gesture-based control in various applications.
- **Robust Performance**: Our hand tracking system performs well under different lighting conditions and backgrounds.


## Applications
This hand tracking system can be used in various fields such as:
- Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)
- Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
- Sign Language Recognition
